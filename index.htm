          <p> Welcome to my webpage. I'm Elvis Leong Jin Wai, currently studying at MAD for DMC. Some of my interests includes:
            <ul>
              <li><a href=""> Music</a> </li>
              <li><a href=""> Watching endless amounts of random videos of various genres.</a> </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ptrmatic/">Taking photos, mostly street stuff.</a> </li>
            </ul><br>
            Before the start of this semester, I had absolutely no idea what this course was
            about. After I found out, I realised just how far apart my Diploma
            and this course was in relevance. But hey, thanks to this module, I had to learn HTML way ahead of schedule
            and saved myself alot of misery in WPD.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way, this is how I look like.
