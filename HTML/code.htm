          <h1> The Code</h1>
          <p class="ramblings">
            After designing the box last week, I decided to work on the software this week. I first wrote down what I wanted to accomplish in the code, before searching up how to create them
            <br>
            <br>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td>On Boot Up</td>
                <td>Introductory text displays</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>On button press</td>
                <td>Life count increases or decreases.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>When life his a certain count.</td>
                <td>Neopixel will change color.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            With these objectives set in mind, I proceded to code using the Arduino IDE, while using youtube videos and online resources are reference.

            <br>
            The first hurdle I had to climb was finding out how to get the Uno Board to remember the Life count every loop without changing. After some research,
            I came across <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/StateChangeDetection">StateChangeDecection</a>, and though I didn't completely understand,
             solved the issue of the life count reseting to the one set in the code after every loop.

            <br>
            The next hurdle I had was figuring out how to get the display and ligths to change according to the Life count. I did some light research and
            realised I could just use IfElse statement to accomplish this, and that's what I did, till I came across a new issue when the text would eat and overlap
            into each other. Using IfElse Statements again, I cleared the screen at every threshold (the Life count where the text and Neopixel color changes) so the text no longer overlaps.

            <br>
            The last challenge I had was trying to get a balance between user input and the loop speed. Too fast and it becomes uncontrollable, too slow and i becomes unresponsive. After testing, I decided to use a
            delay of 0.2 seconds per loop.
