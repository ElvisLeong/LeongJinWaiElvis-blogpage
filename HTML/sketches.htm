          <h1> Sketch</h1>
          <p class="ramblings">
            Currently, the life counter i use is in the form of an app. It serves its purpose rather well, but looks rather boring as it only has the life on it. In addition, there isn't a place
            to showcase my general when I'm playing. Now, given this oppoturnity, I wanted to make a flashy counter that not only will turn heads duing gameplay, but also allow me to promiently display my general
            on it with a dedicated slot.
          </p>
          <p class="ramblings">
            To get the sizing right for the shell, i first took some measurements of a single MTG card (64x88mm), the lcd panel and added some padding along all the sides so as to ensure all elements would
            fit in the box. this came to a box of 140x90x60mm.
          </p>
          <p class=" ramblings">These are the sketches i made to help me conceptualise the box.</p>
