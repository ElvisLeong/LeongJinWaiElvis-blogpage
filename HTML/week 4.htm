          <p>CAD gives us the ability to create, simulate and modify designs anytime, anywhere as long as we have access to out computer.
              The graphics used can be divided into 2 different catagories, Rater and Vector.

                <td>
                  Manily used to deal with pixels on the screen, Raster images are used mainly to render images and scaling them up will cause a result in less fidelity.<br>
                  Important resoultions (measured as dpi (dots per inch)), the higher the amount of memory required to stor the image.
                    <ul style="padding-left:15px;">
                      <li>72 dpi Applie/Mac screen resolution</li>

                <td> Instead of pixels, Vector images uses math to determine the proportions of the image.<br>
                    Because they use math, the results can be zoomed in and out without any distortion.<br>
                    Some commonly used software are Adobe Illustrator and its free counterpart Inkscape.<br>
                    Some commonly used File Formats are .dxf, .svg and STEP.
