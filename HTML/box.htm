          <h1>The Box</h1>
          <p class="ramblings">
            After sketching up the design of the box, I used Fusion360 to create a 3d model of it.
          </p>
          <p class="ramblings"> The box is mainly made up of 3mm thick plywood, with some acrilic splashed onto the sides to allow light to shine through.</p>
          <p class="ramblings">After some tinkering around with the positioning and size of everything, this is what I ended up with.</p>
          <img src="../Images/box model 1.png" alt="" style="position: relative; display: block; left:40vh;">
          <p class="ramblings">
            There are 2 holes on the top of the box, the smaller one is to house the LCD display, and the second larger one is for someone to place their commander card while at the same time serve
            as a way for someone to troubleshoot and reconnect wires should anything go south like say, the life counter gets smacked onto the ground by some angered players. As unlinkely as that sounds, that
            literally happened to me in my most recent game where someone just staxed the table and not let us do anything soo.
            <br>
            <br>
            the triangular holes on the side are where users can press buttons to increase or decrease their life count. Initially, i planned for the buttons to be at the top right in the box, like where the volume buttons on my phone
            are. but after watching and playing a few games, I realised its much easier for players if the buttons were placed on the bottom instead as the life counter is normally placed in the center of the players and will be quite far from them.
            If the buttons are on the bottom instead, users won't need to strain so much to press the buttons, making it easier to use.
