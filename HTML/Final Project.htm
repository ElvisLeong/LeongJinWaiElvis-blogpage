          <h1> Final Project </h1>
          <p class="ramblings">For my final project, I've decided to tackle the <b>oh so ever popular </b> Useless machine.
            <br>Much like myself, when pushed or "activated", it will resist and turn itself off.</p>
          <p class="ramblings">The most basic of "useless machines" consists of a switch to trigger it and a way to turn itself off,
              like a lever of some kind that can acuate the swith, all housed in a box of some kind.
