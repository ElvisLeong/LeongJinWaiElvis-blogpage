          <h1> Final Project </h1>
          <p class="ramblings">For my final project, I've decided to create something that'll be useful to me as a Magic: The Gathering player,
          a life indicator. </p>
          <p class="ramblings">
            As a MTG player, especially a Commander Player, life totals can sometimes get very messy, and even more so when you're playing a very
            life gain heavy deck(Like my god awful Oloro deck). Before the invention of Apps like life linkr, we relied on using either D20 dices
            or those spinning life counters from anthology sets, and some player even made 3D life counters using spare cards they had.
            <br>
            <br>
            I, like many other commander players, want to find ways to make ourselves stand out. Many have resorted to getting alters fo their
            favourite commanders, some have even gotten custom resin deck boxes, but very few so far have decided to do anything in regards to
            what might possibly be the most important part of the game (not counting your actual cards), the way your life is displayed!
              <br>
